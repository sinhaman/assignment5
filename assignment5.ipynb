    "\n",
    "1. Compiled Languages:\n",
    "Compilation Process: In a compiled language, the source code is translated into machine code (binary code) by a compiler before execution. This machine code is usually specific to the platform and can be executed directly by the computer's CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "Execution: Once compiled, the program can be run multiple times without needing to recompile, which makes the execution faster.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Interpreted Languages:\n",
    "Interpretation Process: In an interpreted language, the source code is executed line-by-line or instruction-by-instruction by an interpreter. It does not compile into machine code ahead of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Execution: The program requires the interpreter to run, and this means the code is typically slower because it is being translated on the fly.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Try Block:\n",
    "The first step is to place the code that might raise an exception inside a try block. The code within this block will be executed normally.\n",
    "\n",
    "If no exception occurs, the program continues as normal. If an exception is raised, the control is passed to the corresponding except block.\n",

    "\n",
    "You can catch specific exceptions (e.g., ZeroDivisionError, ValueError) or use a general except block to catch all exceptions.\n",

    "Q13.Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
    "ANS:Memory management in Python is crucial for several reasons, as it directly affects the performance, efficiency, and reliability of your programs. Here are the key reasons why memory management is important:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Efficient Use of Resources:\n",
    "Memory is a finite resource. If a program uses too much memory or doesn't release it when it's no longer needed, it can lead to memory exhaustion or slowdowns, causing your program (or even your entire system) to crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proper memory management ensures that memory is allocated efficiently and released when it's no longer needed, preventing resource wastage.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Preventing Memory Leaks:\n",
    "Memory leaks occur when a program continuously consumes memory without releasing it back to the system. Over time, this can cause the program to use up all available memory, leading to crashes or slowdowns.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the garbage collector and reference counting mechanisms help automatically manage memory, but developers still need to be aware of situations where memory might not be freed properly, like in the case of cyclic references.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Performance Optimization:\n",
    "Efficient memory management can optimize performance by ensuring that objects are stored and retrieved in memory efficiently. Improper memory management can slow down your program, especially when working with large data sets or in performance-critical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, memory pooling for small objects helps reduce the overhead of repeated memory allocations and deallocations, which improves the overall performance of Python programs."
